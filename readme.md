I spent some time playing with the crypto challenges on cryptopals.org.  These
are my solutions.

This code is bad.  I know it's bad.  It's not well factored, not documented,
not performant, and generally pretty ugly.  This was code meant to run once
and be forgotten.

Still, I'd like to back it up so it doesn't end up like, e.g. the code for the
last time I played with the matasano crypto challenges.  That's what this is.
